### The problems with the other monets
- CacheMonet
  1. Audio button does not work
  2. Uses an old version of jquery (2.0.3), which is vulerable to XSS attacks
  3. Has the lowest gif count of all monets
- CacheMonetReloaded
  1. Uses tons of unnesecary JS
  2. Has an ad embedded in the music
  3. Does not have all original gifs
