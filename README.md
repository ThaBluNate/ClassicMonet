A homage to 10 years of [#cachemonet](http://cachemonet.com) and 5 years of [#cachemonetreloaded](https://github.com/Yihwan/cache-monet-reloaded)

However, [cachemonet](http://cachemonet.com) has broken music and [cachemonetreloaded](https://github.com/Yihwan/cache-monet-reloaded)'s website is down. (And niether are being updated)
