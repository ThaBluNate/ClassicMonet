# [ClassicMonet](https://ThaBluNate.github.io/ClassicMonet/)
###### Coming (fully) 2023

A homage to 10 years of [#cachemonet](http://cachemonet.com) and 5 years of [#cachemonetreloaded](https://github.com/Yihwan/cache-monet-reloaded)

However, [cachemonet](http://cachemonet.com) has broken music and [cachemonetreloaded](https://github.com/Yihwan/cache-monet-reloaded)'s website is down. (And niether are being updated)

### What does ClassicMonet have over CacheMonet and CacheMonetReloaded?
| - | CacheMonet | CacheMonetReloaded | ClassicMonet |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

| Has all original GIFs  | Yes  | No  | Yes |
| Anount of GIFs added | 91  | +52  | -  |
| Full options | No | Yes  | No  |

Keep in mind that cachemonet reloaded not only has original GIFs, but it will also include CacheMonetReloaded's GIFs too

But for now, a demo with only the original ones
