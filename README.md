# [ClassicMonet](https://ThaBluNate.github.io/ClassicMonet/)
###### Coming (fully) before 2023

A homage to 10 years of [#cachemonet](http://cachemonet.com) and 5 years of [#cachemonetreloaded](https://github.com/Yihwan/cache-monet-reloaded)

However, [cachemonet](http://cachemonet.com) is on an old version of jquery, as well as being broken all-round and [cachemonetreloaded](https://github.com/Yihwan/cache-monet-reloaded)'s website is down. (Niether are being updated)

### What does ClassicMonet have over CacheMonet and CacheMonetReloaded?
| - | CacheMonet | CacheMonetReloaded | ClassicMonet |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Has Music  | No  | With ads  | Yes  |
| Has all original GIFs  | Yes  | No  | Yes |
| Anount of GIFs added | 91  | 91+52  | 91+52  |
| Full options | No | Yes  | No  |
| Has PWA | No | No  | Yes  |

Keep in mind that cachemonet reloaded not only has original GIFs, but it will also include CacheMonetReloaded's GIFs too

But for now, a demo with only the original ones

pssssst:
I haven't been working on this project, the latest update to this repository was me just changing the date of release.
Today, i took a look at the code and just the immediate wonder of what the hell i was going rolled in.
This code is probably the worst website code i've ever seen.

I'm remaking it completley
